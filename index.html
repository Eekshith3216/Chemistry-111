                    <p>Moodle stands for Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment and statistics. Moodle is free software, a learning management system providing a platform for e-learning and it helps the various teachers considerably in conceptualizing the various courses, course structures and curriculum thus facilitating interaction with online students. It is configurable, highly-flexible, and feature-rich. RSCOPR has a self-customized MOODLE developed by Digital Content development team. (https://lms.jspmrscopr.edu.in/).

                        It is a very useful platform to share all learning resources, videos, sharing webpage. Moodle supports a range of media to present or link to learning materials, support the students and to assess their learning. It is able to provide automated assessment in the form of quiz, and give immediate detailed feedback to the students.  The messaging system allows learners and teachers to communicate easily. Teachers can also communicate with groups of learners via course forums either to provide answers to learners’ questions or to just get involved in discussions. The uploaded learning resources are available to the students whenever they want them. The MOODLE mobile app makes students access even easier via smartphone or mobile device.</p>

                    <p>In the classroom today, teachers need to do more than just expose students to ICT tools and resources in order to develop student ICT capability. Throughout the curriculum, there are ample opportunities for teachers to accomplish this. As a 21st century skill, ICT capability is best created when ICT is sitting transparently in the background of a subject context and is used to enhance its learning in a purposeful and meaningful context. It is essential that you intellectually challenge students in their use of ICT. Here are some points to remember:

                        • Progression in ICT capability is facilitated through the broadening and elaborating context and ICT environments; • Use more sophisticated software in response to the demands of the task – the aim is to broaden and elaborate contexts and use more sophisticated software as a consequence of the increasing elaboration of curriculum context; • The student must find and overcome difficulties for learning to occur and; • Maintain an appropriate balance between the factors according the objectives of the activity.</p>
